## Tree-Based Models

For this assignment, we will continue working with the file `"pokemon.csv"`, found in `/data`. The file is from Kaggle: <https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon>.

The [Pokémon](https://www.pokemon.com/us/) franchise encompasses video games, TV shows, movies, books, and a card game. This data set was drawn from the video game series and contains statistics about 721 Pokémon, or "pocket monsters." In Pokémon games, the user plays as a trainer who collects, trades, and battles Pokémon to (a) collect all the Pokémon and (b) become the champion Pokémon trainer.

Each Pokémon has a [primary type](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Type) (some even have secondary types). Based on their type, a Pokémon is strong against some types, and vulnerable to others. (Think rock, paper, scissors.) A Fire-type Pokémon, for example, is vulnerable to Water-type Pokémon, but strong against Grass-type.

The goal of this assignment is to build a statistical learning model that can predict the **primary type** of a Pokémon based on its generation, legendary status, and six battle statistics.

**Note: Fitting ensemble tree-based models can take a little while to run. Consider running your models outside of the .Rmd, storing the results, and loading them in your .Rmd to minimize time to knit.**

# install.packages("vip")
# install.packages("randomForest")
# install.packages("xgboost")

### Exercise 1

Read in the data and set things up as in Homework 5:

- Use `clean_names()`
```{r}
pokemon <- read_csv("~/Downloads/homework-5/data/Pokemon.csv") %>%
  clean_names()
```

- Filter out the rarer Pokémon types

```{r}
pokemon <- pokemon %>%
  filter(type_1 == "Bug" | type_1 == "Fire" | type_1 =="Grass" | type_1 =="Normal" | type_1 =="Water" | type_1 =="Psychic")
table(pokemon$type_1)
```

- Convert `type_1` and `legendary` to factors

```{r}
pokemon <- pokemon %>%
  mutate(type_1 = as.factor(type_1)) %>%
  mutate(legendary = as.factor(legendary))
class(pokemon$type_1)
```
```{r}
class(pokemon$legendary)
```


Do an initial split of the data; you can choose the percentage for splitting. Stratify on the outcome variable.
Fold the training set using *v*-fold cross-validation, with `v = 5`. Stratify on the outcome variable.

```{r}
set.seed(116)
pokemon_split <- initial_split(pokemon, prop =0.8, strata = "type_1")

pokemon_train <- training(pokemon_split)
pokemon_test <- testing(pokemon_split)

pokemon_fold <- vfold_cv(pokemon_train, v = 5, strata = "type_1")

458*0.8  #Which is 366.4, so it is reasonable to have 364 observations in the training data.
```


Set up a recipe to predict `type_1` with `legendary`, `generation`, `sp_atk`, `attack`, `speed`, `defense`, `hp`, and `sp_def`:

- Dummy-code `legendary` and `generation`;
- Center and scale all predictors.

```{r}
pokemon_recipe <- recipe(type_1 ~ legendary + generation + sp_atk + attack + speed + defense + hp + sp_def,
                         data = pokemon_train) %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>%
  step_normalize(all_predictors())
```


### Exercise 2

Create a correlation matrix of the training set, using the `corrplot` package. *Note: You can choose how to handle the continuous variables for this plot; justify your decision(s).*

```{r}
library(corrplot)
```


```{r}
pokemon_train %>%
  select(total, hp, attack,defense, sp_atk, sp_def, speed, generation) %>%
  cor() %>%
  corrplot()
```


What relationships, if any, do you notice? Do these relationships make sense to you?

```{r}
#I find out that total is positively correlated with hp, attack, defense, sp_atk, speed, and sp_def. sep_def is also positively correlated with defense and seo_atk. These relationship makes sense. As the total level goes up, all the other variables will increase as well. 
```


### Exercise 3

First, set up a decision tree model and workflow. Tune the `cost_complexity` hyperparameter. Use the same levels we used in Lab 7 -- that is, `range = c(-3, -1)`. Specify that the metric we want to optimize is `roc_auc`. 

Print an `autoplot()` of the results. What do you observe? Does a single decision tree perform better with a smaller or larger complexity penalty?

```{r}
tree_spec <- decision_tree() %>%
  set_engine("rpart")
```
```{r}
class_tree_spec <- tree_spec %>%
  set_mode("classification")
```

```{r}
class_tree_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(class_tree_spec %>% set_args(cost_complexity = tune())) %>%
  add_recipe(pokemon_recipe)
```

```{r}
set.seed(131)
param_grid <- grid_regular(cost_complexity(range = c(-3, -1)), levels = 10)

tune_res <- tune_grid(
  class_tree_wf, 
  resamples = pokemon_fold, 
  grid = param_grid, 
  metrics = metric_set(roc_auc)
)
```

```{r}
autoplot(tune_res)
```

### Exercise 4

What is the `roc_auc` of your best-performing pruned decision tree on the folds? *Hint: Use `collect_metrics()` and `arrange()`.*

```{r}
matrix = collect_metrics(tune_res) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean))
matrix
#So, the best performing pruned decision tree is Preprocessor1_Model04.
```


### Exercise 5

Using `rpart.plot`, fit and visualize your best-performing pruned decision tree with the *training* set.

```{r}
best_complexity <- select_best(tune_res)

class_tree_final <- finalize_workflow(class_tree_wf, best_complexity)

class_tree_final_fit <- fit(class_tree_final, data = pokemon_train)
```
```{r}
class_tree_final_fit %>%
  extract_fit_engine() %>%
  rpart.plot()
```


### Exercise 5

Now set up a random forest model and workflow. Use the `ranger` engine and set `importance = "impurity"`. Tune `mtry`, `trees`, and `min_n`. Using the documentation for `rand_forest()`, explain in your own words what each of these hyperparameters represent.
```{r}
#install.packages("ranger")
library(ranger)
```



```{r}
rf_spec <- rand_forest(mtry = tune(), trees = tune(), min_n = tune()) %>%
  set_engine("ranger", importance = "impurity") %>%
  set_mode("classification")
```
```{r}
rf_wf = workflow() %>%
  add_model(rf_spec) %>%
  add_recipe(pokemon_recipe)
```

Create a regular grid with 8 levels each. You can choose plausible ranges for each hyperparameter. Note that `mtry` should not be smaller than 1 or larger than 8. **Explain why not. What type of model would `mtry = 8` represent?**

```{r}
rf_grid = grid_regular(mtry(range = c(1, 8)), trees(range = c(1, 100)), min_n(range = c(1, 15)), levels = 8)
```
Because mtry is the number of predictors, so we could only have 1-8 predictors in this model. when mtry = 8 means that all the predictor will be used in the random forest model. 

### Exercise 6

Specify `roc_auc` as a metric. Tune the model and print an `autoplot()` of the results. What do you observe? What values of the hyperparameters seem to yield the best performance?



```{r}
#similarly, repear what we did in the previous part.
set.seed(131)

rf_tune_res <- tune_grid(
  rf_wf, 
  resamples = pokemon_fold, 
  grid = rf_grid, 
  metrics = metric_set(roc_auc)
)
```

```{r}
autoplot(rf_tune_res)
```


### Exercise 7

What is the `roc_auc` of your best-performing random forest model on the folds? *Hint: Use `collect_metrics()` and `arrange()`.*

```{r}
matrix1 = collect_metrics(rf_tune_res) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean))
matrix1
#So, the best performing pruned decision tree is Preprocessor1_Model285.
```


### Exercise 8

Create a variable importance plot, using `vip()`, with your best-performing random forest model fit on the *training* set.

```{r}
rf_best <- select_best(rf_tune_res)

rf_final <- finalize_workflow(rf_wf, rf_best)

rf_final_fit <- fit(rf_final, data = pokemon_train)
```

Which variables were most useful? Which were least useful? Are these results what you expected, or not?

```{r}
rf_final_fit %>%
  pull_workflow_fit() %>%
  vip()
```
The most important variable is sp_atk and legendary_True is the least important variable. Altough I did not expect that legendary_True is the least important. Based on my game experience, I thought speed is the least important one.

### Exercise 9

Finally, set up a boosted tree model and workflow. Use the `xgboost` engine. Tune `trees`. Create a regular grid with 10 levels; let `trees` range from 10 to 2000. Specify `roc_auc` and again print an `autoplot()` of the results. 

```{r}
boost_spec <- boost_tree(trees = tune()) %>%
  set_engine("xgboost") %>%
  set_mode("classification")
```

```{r}
boost_wf = workflow() %>%
  add_model(boost_spec) %>%
  add_recipe(pokemon_recipe)
```

```{r}
boost_grid = grid_regular(trees(range = c(10, 2000)), levels =10)
```

```{r}
set.seed(131)

boost_tune_res <- tune_grid(
  boost_wf, 
  resamples = pokemon_fold, 
  grid = boost_grid, 
  metrics = metric_set(roc_auc)
)
```

```{r}
autoplot(boost_tune_res)
```


What do you observe?

the roc_auc increases very fast from 0 to 1300 and reaches it maximum value at 1300. It starts decreasing at 1300 and goes back at 1550 to 2000.

What is the `roc_auc` of your best-performing boosted tree model on the folds? *Hint: Use `collect_metrics()` and `arrange()`.*

```{r}
matrix2 = collect_metrics(boost_tune_res) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean))
matrix2
#So, the best performing pruned decision tree is Preprocessor1_Model07.
```


### Exercise 10

Display a table of the three ROC AUC values for your best-performing pruned tree, random forest, and boosted tree models. Which performed best on the folds? Select the best of the three and use `select_best()`, `finalize_workflow()`, and `fit()` to fit it to the *testing* set. 

Print the AUC value of your best-performing model on the testing set. Print the ROC curves. Finally, create and visualize a confusion matrix heat map.

Which classes was your model most accurate at predicting? Which was it worst at?

### Exercise 11

Using the `abalone.txt` data from previous assignments, fit and tune a random forest model to predict `age`. Use stratified cross-validation and select ranges for `mtry`, `min_n`, and `trees`. Present your results. What was the model's RMSE on your testing set?
